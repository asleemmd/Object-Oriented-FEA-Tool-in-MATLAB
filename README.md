# Object-Oriented Finite Element Analysis Tool in MATLAB (MVC Architecture)

This project presents a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) solver for bar and frame structures, built in MATLAB using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The tool provides both computational efficiency and an interactive interface for structural analysis.

📌 **Project Overview:**

Implemented a fully functional FEM solver for bar and frame structures.

Applied OOP principles and MVC design pattern for modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

Built a MATLAB App interface for user-friendly interaction.

Supports linear static analysis, visualization of results, and multiple rendering modes.

🚀 **Key Features:**

✅ Object-Oriented FEM solver (Bar & Frame elements)

✅ MVC architecture for clean separation of model, view, and controller

✅ Interactive MATLAB App GUI

✅ Model creation, meshing, load & boundary condition assignment

✅ Linear static analysis with solution of nodal displacements, reactions, and stresses

✅ Visualization of deflections, support reactions, and stress distribution

✅ Dual rendering modes: structured view & FEM mesh view

🛠️ **Tools & Technologies:**

MATLAB (App Designer, OOP) – Core implementation & interface

Finite Element Method (FEM) – Structural analysis solver

MVC Design Pattern – Software architecture for modular design

📊 **Results & Demonstration:**

Successfully tested on bar and frame problems with accurate displacement and stress predictions.

Provided engineers with intuitive visualization of structural behavior.

Demonstrated how modern software engineering practices (OOP + MVC) can enhance FEM solver design.
